# S3 Storage - SRIN Take-Home Assignments

**Write down as answer for every command used and result in each S3 operation below and explain your answer.**

**Bucket operation:**

- **Create bucket:** The appropriate command for this operation is ****`create-bucket`.** When we create a bucket, we need to define a bucket name and its region. This produces a bucket where objects are contained.
- **Delete bucket:**  If we delete a bucket, another user can use the previous bucket name. This is because bucketsâ€™ names have to be unique. Deleting a bucket will also delete all objects contained inside the bucket.

**Object operation:**

- **Create object:**
- **Update object:**
